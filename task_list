* add dql_query to work with union, intersect or except, as binary operators
  * check operator precedence and then only combine
  struct dql_query
  {
      dql_node_type type; {SET_OPERATION SELECT_QUERY}
      union
      {
        struct
        {
            set_operation_type set_op_type;
            set_operation_result_type set_op_result_type; // ALL / DISTINCT -> check what is default
            dql_query* left;
            dql_query* right;
        };
        struct
        {
          ...
        } select_query;
      };
  };
  dql_query :
    select_query
    | values_query
    | OPEN_BRACKET dql_query CLOSE_BRACKET
    | dql_query INTERSECT dql_query
    | dql_query UNION dql_query
    | dql_query EXCEPT dql_query
  now we can replace sub_query replacing it with dql_query

* parse INSERT
  * use dql_query as input for insert statements

* add %destructor rules



* SQL QUERY
DDL (create alter drop)
 * start with create table, database and index queries
 * start with alter table, database and index querires
 * start with drop table, database and index queries

* add case and when statements in sql expression for parse tree

* flatten a - b expression into a + (-b) as flat addition list, if either a or b is a constant, do that same for a/b
* make a function to make queries flatten their operators in sql expressions
* make a function to make queries unfold their constants in sql expressions (use GNU MP for this)

* add distinct and unique for projections of the select query
