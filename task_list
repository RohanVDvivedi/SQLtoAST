PICKED TASKS

* add exists and not exists as operators over queries in sql_expression
  * EXISTS ( sub_query ) %prec EXISTS_PREC
  * L_NOT EXISTS ( sub_query ) %prec EXISTS_PREC
  * place its precedence between logixal and comparison operators

* add dql_query to work with union, intersect or except, as binary operators
  * check operator precedence and then only combine
  struct dql_query
  {
      dql_node_type type; {SET_OPERATION SELECT_QUERY}
      union

        struct
        {
            set_operation_type set_op_type;
            set_operation_result_type set_op_result_type; // ALL / DISTINCT -> check what is default

        {
          ...
        } select_query;
      };
  };

* parse INSERT

* add %destructor rules



* SQL QUERY
DDL (create alter drop)
 * start with create table, database and index queries
 * start with alter table, database and index querires
 * start with drop table, database and index queries

* add case and when statements in sql expression for parse tree

* flatten a - b expression into a + (-b) as flat addition list, if either a or b is a constant, do that same for a/b
* make a function to make queries flatten their operators in sql expressions
* make a function to make queries unfold their constants in sql expressions (use GNU MP for this)

* add distinct and unique for projections of the select query
