PICKED TASKS
 * remove extensive newlines and tabs from printing debug version of queries, and print them in single line and with clauses around brackets and expressions
 * test the existing run_tests with test_cases for sql expression by making them into the queries, and verify their parse trees again using chatgpt
 * in clause to take in dql_query
 * any/some, all as expression that take in a sub query and can only be RHS of the comparison operators
   * ANY, SOME, ALL :::::           a < ANY (select score from students)
   * IN / NOT INT ::::::            a in (select id from students where passed = true)
 * ask chatgpt for more complex sql queries atleast 30 and add them to tests

* SQL QUERY
DQL (select) and then DML (insert (need values as relation_input) update delete)
 * where and select sub query can also be used in insert, update and delete queries
TCL is very simple, do that right after DML parsing rules
DDL (create alter drop)
 * start with create table, database and index queries
 * start with alter table, database and index querires
 * start with drop table, database and index queries

* add case and when statements in sql expression for parse tree

* flatten a - b expression into a + (-b) as flat addition list, if either a or b is a constant, do that same for a/b
* make a function to make queries flatten their operators in sql expressions
* make a function to make queries unfold their constants in sql expressions (use GNU MP for this)

* subqueries can only be select queries
*SQL EXPRESSIONS that work with sub queries
 * EXISTS / NOT EXISTS :::::::
 * UNIQUE ::::
 etc (check for all operators like these)
