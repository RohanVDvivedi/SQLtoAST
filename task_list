TO BE PICKED TASKS

DISTINCT/UNIQUE/ALL
* distinct and unique are synonyms and can be place right between select keyword and the projection list
 * applicable to the whole projection list, but it optional, and distinct_opt must be used to refer to none, distinct and unique in parser rules
* distinct is also allowed inside aggregate functions (UNIQUE is not allowed here)
 * this include inside COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN and MAX (although it it a no-on for the last 2)
 * make function operator have distinct flag if it has only 1 parameter

* SQL QUERY
DDL (create alter drop)
 * start with create table, database and index queries
 * start with alter table, database and index querires
 * start with drop table, database and index queries

* add case and when statements in sql expression for parse tree

* flatten a - b expression into a + (-b) as flat addition list, if either a or b is a constant, do that same for a/b
* make a function to make queries flatten their operators in sql expressions
* make a function to make queries unfold their constants in sql expressions (use GNU MP for this)
