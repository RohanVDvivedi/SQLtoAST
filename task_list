* SQL EXPRESSION
 * add is true, is false and is unknown -> read what is standard, is it = or is necesary?
 * add is NULL and is not NULL operators -> why not use = NULL instead?
 * add SUBSTRING operator -> read what is standard grammar?
 * add cast operation to a type -> readh about its grammar?
 * check if there is an operator to get type of a variable -> very good point
 * implement ALL ANY and SOME operators -> what are they even?

* SQL QUERY
DQL (select) and then DML (insert update delete)
 * start with select query
 * where, order by, from, join, group by, having clauses, decalre them in the order they appear in the generic unoptimized execution plan
 * any of these clause can point to a expression or a sub query
 * in operator can also point to a sub query
 * same pieces can also be used in insert, update and delete queries
DDL (create alter drop)
 * start with create table, database and index queries
 * start with alter table, database and index querires
 * start with drop table, database and index queries

--------

 * read about SQL ANSI standard
 * keep AST and logical query plan separate
 * we only build logical query plan

 * add lexer and parser rules
 * make it build AST
