PICKED TASKS

DDL query
 * create queries
 * alter queries

TO BE PICKED TASKS

* add WITH keywork usage
* add column aliases after table alias like
 * select * from (select * from v) as t(a,b,c)

* make a function to make queries unfold their constants in sql expressions (use GNU MP for this)

* think if we still want this?
* prepared statements and the dynamic sql
 * named paramaters can be a problem, if we also do constant unfolding and we might loose the order of the params and may end up with wrong params at wring places
 * we need to support just ?, ?1, ?2, etc and also :a, :b etc
