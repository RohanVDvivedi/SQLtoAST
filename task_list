PICKED TASKS
 * test
    * remove extensive newlines and tabs from printing debug version od queries
 	* stream line outputs into linear queries with brackets, to easily pass them in chatgpt for verification
 	* make expressions in test_cases.txt be made into queries and passed according to the ansi sql expressions
 	* ask chatgpt for more complex sql queries atleast 30 and add them to tests

* SQL QUERY
DQL (select) and then DML (insert (need values as relation_input) update delete)
 * order by, group by
 * where and select sub query can also be used in insert, update and delete queries
TCL is very simple, do that right after DML parsing rules
DDL (create alter drop)
 * start with create table, database and index queries
 * start with alter table, database and index querires
 * start with drop table, database and index queries

* subqueries can only be select queries
*SQL EXPRESSIONS that work with sub queries
 * ANY, SOME, ALL :::::           a < ANY (select score from students)
 * IN / NOT INT ::::::            a in (select id from students where passed = true)
 * EXISTS / NOT EXISTS :::::::
 * UNIQUE ::::
 etc (check for all operators like these)

--------

 * read about SQL ANSI standard
 * keep AST and logical query plan separate
 * we only build logical query plan

 * add lexer and parser rules
 * make it build AST
